# sort-weekdays
One way to sort weekdays in order of "appearance."
I'm sure there are better techniques, maybe even something baked into php, but I didn't find it and needed something quick and dirty so I could move on to other things.
# Usage
Example: pass in array of (Tuesday,Monday,Friday) and get back (Monday,Tuesday,Friday).
